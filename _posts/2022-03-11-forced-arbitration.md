Forced arbitration effectively lets employers violate employment laws with
impunity. Also known as mandatory binding arbitration, forced arbitration is a
common clause in employment contracts which restricts disputes to
employer-friendly hearings conducted by a private arbitration company. No
equitable employment relationship is possible under the specter of forced
arbitration.

advice._

# What if...

* You or your partner is expecting a child. Excited, you announce the news to
  your coworkers! Soon afterward, you are denied a promised promotion on the
  basis that you'll soon be taking [mp]aternity leave. Your employer has
  violated the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.

* You develop a medical condition which requires you to take medication during
  your workday. Taking your medication means you have to leave your desk briefly
  each day, but this doesn't impact your productivity. Your boss confronts you
  about your routine of leaving your desk to take your medication. Despite your
  explanation, your boss fires you. You have been wrongfully terminated.

* You develop a repetitive stress injury while working. You file a worker's
  compensation claim. On receiving your claim, your employer cuts your salary or
  fires you. In many US states, you have been illegally retaliated against.

Under normal circumstances, in each of these scenarios you could recover damages
in court from your employer for their illegal actions. If they violate the law
against your coworkers as well, you could all take your employer to court
together in a class-action lawsuit.

# A perpetual get out of jail free card

**Forced arbitration removes your right to take your employer to court**. Forced
arbitration clauses often also prohibit class-action lawsuits. If you had signed
an arbitration agreement in each of the above examples, you wouldn't be able to
sue your employer in court.

Instead, your only option would be an arbitration hearing. Arbitration is
conducted in private by a company selected by your employer. Just a sample of
reasons why the deck is stacked against you as an employee:

* The hearing rules are set by the arbitration company, not by the law. You may
  not be able to present the needed evidence or bring the needed experts.
* Arbitration outcomes are final and can't be appealed.
* Arbitration often requires travel to the venue your employer has chosen,
  instead of where you live. You may have to pay out of pocket for travel
  expenses just to get your case heard.
* Arbitrators often rule in favor of employers, because they know they won't
  continue to be selected to arbitrate cases if they rule for employees.
* Arbitration outcomes don't have to be based on any legal merits.

Yes, you read that right. **Arbitration "rulings" don't have to be based on the
legal merits of a dispute.** With forced arbitration, your employer can break
the law, force you into arbitration, and obtain a ruling against you regardless
of any facts.

The unfairness of arbitration is well documented:

* [Mandatory Arbitration Clauses Are Discriminatory and
  Unfair][arbitration-unfair]
* [Forced Arbitration Is Bad News for Employees, California Stats Show][ca-data]
* [The Arbitration Epidemic][arbitration-epidemic]

The inherent unfairness of forced arbitration causes employees who might
otherwise have a legal case against their employer to simply do nothing. In
such cases, the employer faces no consequences for their illegal acts and has no
incentive to stop any illegal practices. This is called a [chilling
effect][wiki-chilling-effect] in relation to employee rights.

Most employees don't want to sue their employers, but it's crucial for employees
to retain the _right_ to sue their employers. Fear of (the cost of) lawsuits is
what motivates employers to follow the law. **When employers face little to no
consequences for violating the law, they have no incentive to obey the law in
the first place.**

Even if your employer doesn't violate any laws, a requirement of forced
arbitration looms over the entire employment relationship. Your employer has
declared from the outset that they won't respect your rights if inconvenient
(read: more expensive) for them.

# Hiding in plain sight

Forced arbitration clauses are often placed at the end of contracts / employment
agreements. It's important to read and understand any employment contract in
full before signing as it can curtail your rights both at and outside of work.

Here's some arbitration language that's been presented to me in two separate job
offers:

> You and [employer] shall submit to mandatory and exclusive binding arbitration
> any and all controversies or claims arising from, or relating to, your
> employment with [employer] and/or the termination of your employment that are
> based upon any federal, state or local ordinance, statute, regulation or
> constitutional provision.

> Through this arbitration agreement ("Agreement"), you and the Company agree
> that all disputes between you and the Company (including its subsidiaries,
> affiliates, successors, partners, employees, officers, directors, insurers,
> agents, investors, contractors, and vendors) must be submitted for binding
> arbitration with JAMS [arbitration company] before a single, neutral
> arbitrator in San Francisco County.
>
> [...]
>
> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN REGARD
> TO CLAIMS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

The brevity of these paragraphs conceals the severity of their effects. An
employee under these terms can't take their employer to court if the employer
violates _any law whatsoever_.

As of 2017, [an estimated over 60 million American workers][epi-60mil] are bound
by forced arbitration clauses in their employment agreements. These numbers are
only increasing.

# Corporate gaslighting

Employers routinely claim:

* _Arbitration is fair._  [Data shows arbitration cases overwhelmingly favor
  employers][ca-data], and that financial awards are lower than outcomes in
  court cases. Arbitrators often rule for the employer to ensure repeat
  business. Most importantly, arbitrators are not required to rule based on the
  legal merits of a case at all!
* _Arbitration is faster than litigation._  [The same data shows arbitration
  cases often take over a year][ca-data]. Regardless, what good is a speedy
  trial if the trial itself is a sham?

Employers understand how forced arbitration benefits them financially. What they
won't admit is these cost savings come from their ability to effectively violate
employment laws at your expense.

# Your rights, Ã  la carte

Some companies exempt sexual harassment claims from their forced arbitration
clauses. After an employee walkout, [Google and several other tech companies
removed sexual harassment from their forced arbitration
clauses][harassment-exemption]. Just days ago, [forced arbitration for sexual
harassment cases became illegal under federal law][harassment-exemption-law].
This is better than forcing sexual harassment claims into arbitration, but
restoring access to a specific legal protection is not enough.

Employment laws discourage and punish all sorts of illegal behavior by
employers. With forced arbitration, companies have exempted themselves from
employment laws and are only restoring access to specific rights and protections
when compelled by collective employee action and/or bad PR.

As employees, the law gives us legal rights. Employers use forced arbitration to
deprive us of those rights by stacking the deck in their favor in all
employment-related legal matters. **We shouldn't have to fight to restore our
existing legal rights one piece at a time.**

# Hiring is hard when employees aren't valued

Software engineers and other tech professionals have been in high demand for
years, [and the job market is only getting
hotter][nyt-tech-hiring-crisis-archive]. Tech companies routinely whine about
the difficulty of hiring and retaining talent.

Despite this, many companies deny us access to our basic employment rights
through forced arbitration. If you are an employer that requires forced
arbitration, you are demonstrating you don't value your employees. Tech workers
have choices, and this is a great way to make candidates choose someone else.

Like most software engineers, I receive constant messages from recruiters. From
the first contact, I'm up front about my refusal to sign a forced arbitration
clause for a job. I've turned down offers after completing full interview rounds
because the company wasn't willing to remove their forced arbitration clause.

**I won't work for any company that demonstrates I'm not valued even before I
sign an offer.**
